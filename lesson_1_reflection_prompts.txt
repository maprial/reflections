How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Helped a lot. Viewing just the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

I would find errors quickly. Learn about my common errors.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros. I have total control when I want to save.
Cons. I can save too big changes or too much small changes..

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

May be it is more efficient. Could be relations among files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log to see the different commits and git diff to see tha changes bteween two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You have several checkpoints where you can back at any moment

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to check my previous works with git
